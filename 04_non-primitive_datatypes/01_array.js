// Ordered Collections: Arrays are non-primitive data types that store an ordered list of values, called elements.
// Versatile Storage: They can hold elements of any data type, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, even other arrays!
// Flexible Organization: Arrays provide a structured way to manage and access multiple pieces of data efficiently.

//// Key Characteristics:

// Zero-Based Indexing: Elements are accessed using numerical indices that start at 0. The first element has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on.
// Mutable: You can add, remove, or modify elements after an array is created.
// Dynamic Size: Arrays can grow or shrink as needed, without a fixed length.


//// Examples 

let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Peach", "Mango",]
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'yellow', 'brown', 'pink', 'blue', 'purple', 'gray']
const even_numbers = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]

//// accessing arrays
// print whole arrays with coma separated values
console.log(fruits)
console.log(colors)
console.log(even_numbers)

// print values individually by square notation
console.log(fruits[1]) // Banana
console.log(fruits[4]) // Mango
console.log(fruits[5]) // undefined 
console.log(even_numbers[5]) // 12

// checking data type
console.log(typeof(fruits)) // showing object type 



// Note : We will learn array and its methods in upcomming steps.
