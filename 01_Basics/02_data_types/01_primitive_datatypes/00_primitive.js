//// They represent simple values that are not objects and have no methods or properties of their own.
//// There are 7 Primitive Data Types In Javascript

// 01 : string
// 02 : number
// 03 : boolean
// 04 : null
// 05 : undefined
// 06 : symbol
// 07 : bigint


// Here are key characteristics of primitive data types:
// Atomic: They represent a single value, not a collection of values.
// Immutable: Their values cannot be changed after they are created.If you try to modify a primitive value, you actually create a new value instead.
// Stored by value: When assigned to a variable, a copy of the value is stored in memory, not a reference to the original value. This means that changing the value of one variable won't affect other variables holding the same primitive value.
// Passed by value to functions: When a primitive value is passed to a function as an argument, a copy of the value is passed, not the original value itself. This means that modifications to the argument within the function won't affect the original value outside the function.
