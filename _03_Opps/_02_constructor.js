// Constructor methods in JavaScript are used for several important reasons:

// Object Initialization: Constructors allow you to create and initialize objects.'
//  They ensure that the newly created object has the necessary properties and initial values.
//   This is especially useful for creating instances of classes or objects that share a common structure.

// Encapsulation: Constructors can encapsulate the initialization logic,
//  making it easier to maintain and understand. All the setup code for an object is contained within the constructor,
//  making it less error-prone and more organized.

// Reusable Blueprint: Constructors define a blueprint for creating objects.
// You can create multiple instances of an object with the same structure and behavior by
//  calling the constructor function multiple times with different arguments.

// Inheritance: Constructors are used in object-oriented programming to implement inheritance.
//  Subclasses can call the constructor of their parent class to inherit properties and behaviors,
//  and then extend or modify them as needed.

// Object Creation with the new Keyword: Constructors are used in conjunction with the new keyword to create
//  instances of objects. This helps differentiate between object creation and regular function calls
//   and ensures that the this keyword inside the constructor refers to the newly created object.

// Code Organization: Constructors promote a structured approach to code organization,
// especially when building complex applications. By defining constructors for different types of objects,
//  you can keep related functionality together, making your codebase more modular.
